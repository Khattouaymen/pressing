## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Database Architecture
```
LocalStorage-based Database
├── clients (Individual clients)
├── pieces (Clothing/item types with pricing)
├── orders (Individual customer orders)
├── professional-clients (B2B clients)
└── professional-orders (B2B orders)
```

### Hook Architecture
```
useDatabase.ts
├── useClients() - Individual client management
├── usePieces() - Piece/item type management  
├── useOrders() - Individual order management
├── useProfessionalClients() - B2B client management
└── useProfessionalOrders() - B2B order management
```

### Component Integration
```
App.tsx (with react-hot-toast)
├── ClientManagement (useClients)
├── PieceManagement (usePieces)
├── OrderManagement (useClients + usePieces + useOrders)
└── ProfessionalDashboard (useProfessionalClients + useProfessionalOrders)
```
